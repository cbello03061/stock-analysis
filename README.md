# Analysis of Results


## Overview of Project
The objective of this challenge is refactoring an initial code even the code fulfilled the purpose that was made and we identify what is the best way to do when we did the analysis and a structure code indented, with comments and easy to understand. 

## Results
The result of both codes are the same, both of them gave us the same numbers in both years, but with different time run and program structure like ident indent code.

## 2017 Original code
Im going to show you a list of things that are the  

### Variables
In the original code we define variables as a Doble and the refactoring code we doit as a Single doing a best management of memory. 

#### Original Code
'3a) Initialize variables for starting price and ending price
' Dim startingPrice As Double
' Dim endingPrice As Double

#### Refacturing Code
'1b) Create output arrays
  'Dim tickerStartingPrices As Single
  'Dim tickerEndingPrices As Single


### Run time
If we have a subrutine more complex, we undestand that the time to spent to run it is more, in this case we did it with a subrutine without a small code than the refactoring code and the time was short than the other.

## Summary
Refactoring is useful even we spent time to do it, it´s a good oportunity of doing of a better way and the momento to undertand things that we didn´t identify in the last. Sometimes we identify a different structure to do it, some variables were declared different and they are doing a bad management of memory. The result of the program is the same, but the way that we can do it is different an more easy to undestand.

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

#### Advantages
Potential advantages of refactoring may include improved code readability and reduced complexity; these can improve the source code's maintainability and create a simpler, cleaner, or more expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility, I think when we refactoring a code, we can learn about it, because maybe when we did that code we had other mental structure and when the time pass we grow up and thin more clearly about the problem that we need to resolve or the goal to achive.

#### Disadvantages
Time Consuming: Because you may have no idea how much time it may take to complete the process. It may also land you into a situation where you have no idea where to go. But if you have enough time, I think is a new opportunity to learn and you can give the easy way that other people understand about it. 


### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

* Pros
  - Think another way to do it 
  - Analize all the variables type and chage them to choose the best}
  - Aanlize if doing something different with the code I can do a better memory mangement
  - Now I have more knowledge of how to program in this tool so a best vision about it.

* Cons
  - I spent more time analizing the code and thinking how it is the better way to program
  - The firt time that I think to refactoring the original code, it was complicated because I was think similar.
